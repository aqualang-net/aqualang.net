# aqualang

**aqualang**, short for 'acquire language', will be a website where you can create and take conlang learning courses. This repository contains both the frontend and backend code of the upcoming website.

This repository contains three main branches: `development`, `staging`, and `production`.

- The `development` branch contains the latest code hot off the press. This is where contributors will be modifying code and testing the website locally.

- Once the code is ready to be deployed, the `development` branch will be merged with the `staging` branch. This automatically deploys the code to [aqualang-staging.herokuapp.com](https://aqualang-staging.herokuapp.com/).

- If deployment is successfull, the [aqualang.net](https://aqualang.net/) website will be updated and the `staging` branch is merged with the `production` branch.

As **aqualang** has not been released, the `production` branch has not yet been created.
