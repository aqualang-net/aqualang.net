# This file describes all error messages given from the API when it sends a 4xx status code
# The payload of those responses will always be:

# This YAML file has the error codes as keys and the messages and status codes as values inside those objects
# Error codes can be added or removed, but must NEVER be renamed
# Messages can be changed whenever
